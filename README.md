It's a chrome extension to lookup android reference in the omnibox and It's forked from [here](http://code.google.com/p/romannurik-code/source/checkout).   
And did a little change to make this extension can read doc from local doc file. It can increase the loading speed a lot when the network isn't very stable.  
You can configure the local doc path in the `background.js` file. Change the `LOCAL_DOC_PATH` var.
